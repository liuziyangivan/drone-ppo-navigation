# Drone Urban Low-Altitude Obstacle Avoidance Navigation



An autonomous drone obstacle avoidance and navigation system based on deep reinforcement learning (PPO algorithm), implemented in AirSim + Unreal Engine 4 simulation environment.



## Results



- Final test success rate: \*\*20/20 = 100%\*\*

- Collision rate: \*\*0%\*\*

- Navigation distance: \~138 meters (including turns)



## Tech Stack



- Simulation: Microsoft AirSim + Unreal Engine 4.27

- RL Algorithm: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

- Framework: Stable-Baselines3 + Gymnasium

- Language: Python 3.8



## File Structure



| File | Description |

|------|-------------|

| `drone\_env.py` | Custom Gym environment with observation space, action space, and reward function |

| `train.py` | PPO training script, supports loading existing model to continue training |

| `test\_model.py` | Model evaluation script, computes success rate and collision rate |



## Setup



```bash

conda create -n uav\_rl python=3.8

conda activate uav\_rl

pip install numpy

pip install msgpack-rpc-python

pip install airsim stable-baselines3 gymnasium torch opencv-python

```



## Usage



*Train the model:*

```bash

conda activate uav\_rl

python train.py

```



*Test the model:*

```bash

python test\_model.py

```



## Training Strategy



Used **Curriculum Learning** to progressively increase task difficulty:



1\. Short-range straight navigation (20m)

2\. Medium-range straight navigation (40m → 60m)

3\. Added lateral offset (turning along Y-axis)

4\. Final long-range complex path (\~138m with turns)



## Reward Function



\- Getting closer to target: `+ distance\_reduction × 2`

\- Time penalty per step: `-0.1`

\- Collision penalty: `-100`

\- Reaching target reward: `+200`



## Requirements



- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1080 or above (RTX 3060+ recommended)

- RAM: 16GB+

- Storage: 100GB+

- OS: Windows 10/11 x64
